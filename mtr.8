.SH DESCRIPTION

.B mtr 
combines the functionaly of the 
.B traceroute
and 
.B ping
programs in a single network diagnostic tool.

.PP
As 
.B mtr 
starts, it investigates the network connection between the host 
.B mtr
runs on and 
.BR HOSTNAME . 
After it determines the address of each network hop between the
machines, it sends a sequence ICMP ECHO requests to each one to
determine the quality of the link to each machine.  As it does this,
it prints running statistics about each machine.


.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-h
.TP
.B \-\-help
.br
Print the summary of command line argument options.

.TP
.B \-v
.TP
.B \-\-version
.br
Print the installed version of mtr.  

.TP
.B \-r
.TP
.B \-\-report
.br
This option puts 
.B mtr
into 
.B report
mode.  When in this mode,
.B mtr
will run for the number of cycles specified by the 
.B \-c
option, and then print statistics and exit.  
.TP
\c
This mode is useful for generating statistics about network quality.  
Note that each running instance of 
.B mtr
generates a significant amount of network traffic.  Using 
.B mtr
at to measure the quality of your network may result in decreased
network performance.  

.TP
.B \-c\ COUNT
.TP
.B \-\-report\-cycles\ COUNT
Use this option to set the number of pings sent to determine
both the machines on the network and the reliability of 
those machines.  Each cycle lasts one second.  This option
is only useful with the
.B -r
option. 

.TP
.B \-t
.TP
.B \-\-curses
.br
Use this option to force 
.B mtr 
to use the curses based terminal
interface (if available).

.TP
.B \-g
.TP
.B \-\-gtk
.br
Use this option to force
.B mtr 
to use the GTK+ based X11 window interface (if available).  
GTK+ must have been available on the system when 
.B mtr 
was built for this to work.  See the GTK+ web page at 
.B http://www.gimp.org/gtk/
for more information about GTK+.

.TP
.B \-i\ SECONDS
.TP
.B \-\-interval\ SECONDS
.br
Use this option to specify the positive number of seconds between ICMP
ECHO requests.  The default value for this parameter is one second.

.SH BUGS

Some modern routers give a lower priority to ICMP ECHO packets than 
to other network traffic.  Consequently, the reliability of these
routers reported by 
.B mtr
will be significantly lower than the actual reliability of 
these routers.
