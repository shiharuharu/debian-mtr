WHAT IS MTR?

  mtr combines the functionality of the 'traceroute' and 'ping' programs 
  in a single network diagnostic tool.

  As mtr starts, it investigates the network connection between the host
  mtr runs on and a user-specified destination host.  After it
  determines the address of each network hop between the machines, 
  it sends a sequence ICMP ECHO requests to each one to determine the 
  quality of the link to each machine.  As it does this, it prints
  running statistics about each machine.

  mtr is distributed under the GNU General Public License. 
  See the COPYING file for details.  

INSTALLING

  Slightly more hints are in the file INSTALL. If this doesn't work
  you could try reading that too.... 

  To begin compiling mtr, first use the included configure script:

	./configure

  The configure script will generate a Makefile.  Build mtr:

	make

  After compiling, install:

	make install

  Note that mtr must be suid-root because it requires access to raw IP 
  sockets.  See SECURITY for security information.

  If you want to build a version that doesn't use GTK, but if you
  DO have GTK installed, you can use 

	./configure --with-gtk-prefix=/we_dont_want_gtk_so_we_use_a_name_that_certainly_doesnt_exist

  It seems the --no_gtk (whatever) doesn't work. Feel free to submit 
  a patch for this, I'm not that familiar with autoconf (it works for
  me :-).
