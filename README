WHAT IS MTR?

  mtr combines the functionaly of the 'traceroute' and 'ping' programs 
  in a single network diagnostic tool.

  As mtr starts, it investigates the network connection between the host
  mtr runs on and a user-specified destination host.  After it
  determines the address of each network hop between the machines, 
  it sends a sequence ICMP ECHO requests to each one to determine the 
  quality of the link to each machine.  As it does this, it prints
  running statistics about each machine.

  mtr is distributed under the GNU General Public License. 
  See the COPYING file for details.  

INSTALLING

  To begin mtr, first use the included configure script:

	./configure

  The configure script will generate a Makefile.  Build mtr:

	make

  After compiling, install:

	make install

  Note that mtr must be suid-root because it requires access to raw IP 
  sockets.  See SECURITY for security information.
