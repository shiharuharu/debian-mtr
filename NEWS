WHAT'S NEW?

  v0.27
	Fixed bug that showed up on Solaris/x86.
	Gimp mainloop now runs as it's supposed to.

  v0.26
        Added "-n" flag for numeric output. 
        fixed IP numbers displaying backwards.
        GTK mainloop now runs at 10 packets per second. 
          - That's too much if there are only 3 hosts
          - that's too little if there are 20 hosts.
        -> Someone tell me how to change the "ping-timeout" 
           callback time in gtk. Can't find it in the docs.
        The default for "hostname" is now "localhost" so that
        you can start mtr without any arguments and later 
        fill in the host you want to trace to. 

  v0.25
        Included two "raw" formats. One for separating GUI from
        the setuid program, and one suitable for later parsing and
        displaying. Volunteers wanted to separate the GTK 
        backend. Thanks to Bertrand Leconte for contributing 
        the format that's now called "split". 

  v0.24 
        Fixed number of probes. Accidentally was counted per 
        packet sent instead of per round of packets. 

  v0.23
        Fixed Sparc alignment problem with statmalloc

  v0.22 
        Roger has take over maintenance. 
        mtr now uses an "int" to pass options to the kernel. 
        Makes things work on Solaris and *BSD I'm told. 
        mtr doesn't fire off a flurry of packets when a new
        second comes around. Instead they are spaced evenly
        around the whole second. This allows people with a 
        relatively slow first link to do meaningful measurements
        of whatever is behind that.

  v0.21
        mtr now drops root permissions after it acquires the raw
        sockets it needs.
	mtr should be a bit happier about building under SCO and
        Solaris.
	Fixed the problem with packets arriving after a reset.

  v0.20
	The build process for mtr now uses automake.
        Fixed a build problem for Irix.
        Now uses non-blocking DNS code, so mtr can attempt
        to do reverse lookup on multiple hosts at once.
	Fewer packets are sent out each cycle, so mtr
	doesn't hog quite so much bandwidth.

  v0.19
	Fixed a type-o in curses.c

  v0.18
	Fixed the network code to work properly under FreeBSD.  
	Hopefully this will fix some other operating systems too.
	Also, fixed a build problem and the DNS hanging bug.

  v0.17
        Fixed the configure script to always like with the math
	library.  Added an icon.

  v0.16
	Added one #include to select.c.  Some people were unable
	to build mtr without this line.  

  v0.15
	Both the build process and the networking code have
	been cleaned up and reorganized.  mtr now builds 
	cleanly with GTK+ 0.99.8.
