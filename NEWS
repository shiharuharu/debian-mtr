WHAT'S NEW?

  v0.47 Fixed a (believed-) non-exploitable bufferoverflow. 
        Thanks Damian. 

  v0.46 Included patch to be able to specify outgoing interface 
        address.

  v0.45 People are pressuring me to release new versions with their
        changes. That's fine. Now this version just adds dynamic
        switching between numeric / dns names, and some minor
        stuff I forgot. This release serves as a code-sycn-release.
        new version with even more new stuff in about two weeks!
        I'm afraid I don't know how to fix the MaxOS-X compilation
        problems in the source. Help wanted... 

  v0.44 David Stone adds the "last" column to the gtk version. 

  v0.43 Compile fixes.

  v0.41 Added afr's patch to allow disabeling of gtk without Robn's hack. 
        Made report mode report the newly added extra resolution. 

  v0.40 Fixed some problems with HPUX and SunOS.
	Included Olav Kvittem's patch to do packetsize option.
	Made the timekeeping in micro seconds.

  v0.39 Forgot the parentheses around the previous fix... :-(

  v0.38 fixed some dubious code in dns.c (noted by someone's lint)

  v0.37 Added Bill Bogstad's "show the local host & time" patch. 
	Added R. Sparks' show-last-ping patch, submitted by Philip Kizer.

  v0.36 Added Craigs change-the-interval-on-the-fly patch.
        Added Moritz Barsnick's "do something sensible if host not found" 
	    patch.
        Some cleanup of both Craigs and Moritz' patches.

  v0.35 Added Craig Milo Rogers pause/resume for GTK patch.
        Added Craig Milo Rogers cleanup of "reset". (restart at the beginning)
        Net_open used to send a first packet. After that the display-driver 
            got a chance to distort the timing by taking its time to 
            initialize.

  v0.34 Added Matt's nifty "use the icmp unreachables to do the timing" patch.
        Added Steve Kann's pause/resume patch. 

  v0.33 Fixed the Linux glibc resolver problems.
        Fixed the off-by-one problem with -c option. 

  v0.32 Fixed the FreeBSD bug detection stuff. 

  v0.31 Fixed a few documentation issues. -- Matt
        Changed the autoconf stuff to find the resolver library on 
            Solaris. -- REW
        Cleaned up the autoconf.in file a bit. -- Matt.

  v0.30 Fixed a typo in the changelog (NEWS) entry for 0.27. :-)
	added use of "MTR_OPTIONS" environment variable for defaults.

  v0.29 Lots of stuff. 
        Neato overview display by David Sward. 
        FreeBSD does wrong in the kernel the same that Solaris/x86 (see 
            note for 0.27 does right. It forces mtr to send bad packets....
        Adjusted "not too much at once" algorithm. Now probing
           continues as long as not more than 5 hosts are unknown.
           Returning packets usually allow us to do the first sweep 
           in one go. 


  v0.28 DNS lookups are now suppressed if you don't want them. 

  v0.27
	Fixed bug that showed up on Solaris/x86.
	GTK mainloop now runs as it's supposed to.

  v0.26
        Added "-n" flag for numeric output. 
        fixed IP numbers displaying backwards.
        GTK mainloop now runs at 10 packets per second. 
          - That's too much if there are only 3 hosts
          - that's too little if there are 20 hosts.
        -> Someone tell me how to change the "ping-timeout" 
           callback time in gtk. Can't find it in the docs.
        The default for "hostname" is now "localhost" so that
        you can start mtr without any arguments and later 
        fill in the host you want to trace to. 

  v0.25
        Included two "raw" formats. One for separating GUI from
        the setuid program, and one suitable for later parsing and
        displaying. Volunteers wanted to separate the GTK 
        backend. Thanks to Bertrand Leconte for contributing 
        the format that's now called "split". 

  v0.24 
        Fixed number of probes. Accidentally was counted per 
        packet sent instead of per round of packets. 

  v0.23
        Fixed Sparc alignment problem with statmalloc

  v0.22 
        Roger has take over maintenance. 
        mtr now uses an "int" to pass options to the kernel. 
        Makes things work on Solaris and *BSD I'm told. 
        mtr doesn't fire off a flurry of packets when a new
        second comes around. Instead they are spaced evenly
        around the whole second. This allows people with a 
        relatively slow first link to do meaningful measurements
        of whatever is behind that.

  v0.21
        mtr now drops root permissions after it acquires the raw
        sockets it needs.
	mtr should be a bit happier about building under SCO and
        Solaris.
	Fixed the problem with packets arriving after a reset.

  v0.20
	The build process for mtr now uses automake.
        Fixed a build problem for Irix.
        Now uses non-blocking DNS code, so mtr can attempt
        to do reverse lookup on multiple hosts at once.
	Fewer packets are sent out each cycle, so mtr
	doesn't hog quite so much bandwidth.

  v0.19
	Fixed a type-o in curses.c

  v0.18
	Fixed the network code to work properly under FreeBSD.  
	Hopefully this will fix some other operating systems too.
	Also, fixed a build problem and the DNS hanging bug.

  v0.17
        Fixed the configure script to always like with the math
	library.  Added an icon.

  v0.16
	Added one #include to select.c.  Some people were unable
	to build mtr without this line.  

  v0.15
	Both the build process and the networking code have
	been cleaned up and reorganized.  mtr now builds 
	cleanly with GTK+ 0.99.8.
