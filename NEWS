WHAT'S NEW?

  v0.21
        mtr now drops root permissions after it acquires the raw
        sockets it needs.
	mtr should be a bit happier about building under SCO and
        Solaris.
	Fixed the problem with packets arriving after a reset.

  v0.20
	The build process for mtr now uses automake.
        Fixed a build problem for Irix.
        Now uses non-blocking DNS code, so mtr can attempt
        to do reverse lookup on multiple hosts at once.
	Fewer packets are sent out each cycle, so mtr
	doesn't hog quite so much bandwidth.

  v0.19
	Fixed a type-o in curses.c

  v0.18
	Fixed the network code to work properly under FreeBSD.  
	Hopefully this will fix some other operating systems too.
	Also, fixed a build problem and the DNS hanging bug.

  v0.17
        Fixed the configure script to always like with the math
	library.  Added an icon.

  v0.16
	Added one #include to select.c.  Some people were unable
	to build mtr without this line.  

  v0.15
	Both the build process and the networking code have
	been cleaned up and reorganized.  mtr now builds 
	cleanly with GTK+ 0.99.8.
