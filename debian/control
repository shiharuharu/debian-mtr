Description: Full screen ncurses or X11 traceroute tool
 mtr combines the functionaly of the 'traceroute' and 'ping' programs 
 in a single network diagnostic tool.
 As mtr starts, it investigates the network connection between the host
 mtr runs on and a user-specified destination host.  After it
 determines the address of each network hop between the machines, 
 it sends a sequence ICMP ECHO requests to each one to determine the 
 quality of the link to each machine.  As it does this, it prints
 running statistics about each machine.
